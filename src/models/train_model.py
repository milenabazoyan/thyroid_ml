# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm

# 1. split processed dataframe to x_train and y_train
# 2. use KNN Classifier to fit and get model, use https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html
# 3. dump model to models/{datetime now}/knn.bin, use "from joblib import dump"
